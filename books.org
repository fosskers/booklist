**** DONE On Writing

2011 sometime
Stephen King

本が書きたくなった。

**** DONE The Associate

2011 sometime
John Grisham

My first Grisham. Pretty interesting, had me caring what happened to the
lead character the whole time.

**** DONE タイム・ラッシュ

2011 sometime
神永学

主人公はあまり好きじゃなかった。書き方もまた、八雲みたいに微妙。

**** DONE Daemon

2011 sometime
Daniel Suarez

Amazing. I AM the target audience. I love all the characters, including the
villains. This is definitely one of my favourite books!

**** DONE 告白

2011 sometime
湊かなえ

すごすぎる。一番好きな日本語の本。

**** DONE The Hobbit

2011 May 22
J.R.R. Tolkien

A classic! Read again for the first time in years. Had many parts I didn't
remember. Tolkien utilized scale very well. Things started off quite simple,
but ended in war and the salvation of a great area and a great many people.

**** DONE Faith of the Fallen

2011 July 25
Terry Goodkind

My favourite book, read for the 3rd(?) time. Awesome morality booster. Life
rocks. People can do anything, and religion can only impede that. I was able
to image many of the scenes in my head with more detail than before. My
reading has improved.

**** DONE Dying Eye

2011 Aug 4
東野圭吾

途中は楽しかったが、最初と最後は少しがっかり。特に最後で、あんな何でも有り得
そうな話を作ったのに、なぜその終わり方を選んだか分からない。自分だったらおそ
らく違う結末にしたと思う。衝撃の面で告白に及ばない。

**** DONE Debt of Bones

2011 Aug 18
Terry Goodkind

An interesting view into Zedd's past! We really get an idea of how powerful
and influential he was during his day. Completely different, and yet somehow
the same as the character that we see in the normal series.

**** DONE Empire of the East

2011 Sept 10
Fred Saberhagen

Great read, although it was a bit hard to get into at first. Cool blend of
technology and magic. Something else that always impresses me also appeared
in this book: scale. The scale of the story increases to great effect as the
plot progresses.

**** DONE Freedom (TM)

2011 Sept 19
Daniel Suarez

New world order... a part of me really thinks this needs to happen. I loved
the whole book, and everything panned out pretty well. Loki was brought down
off his high horse, and the Major got what was coming to him. However, also
like the first book, I felt the author could have done so much more with the
world he created. Peter Sebeck went from being a total noob to kicking ass
while the story was focusing on other characters. And what level did he
become after completing the quest? At least tell us that much. And it wasn't
just about Sebeck... I feel like there was so much more I wanted to know
about the other characters that we didn't get full closure from. Still,
great book.

**** DONE Eye of the World

2011 November
Robert Jordan

Epic... again, with scale! Starts small, gets huge! We really get to see the
characters grow. Also, the author is very skilled at making esoteric
language cool, and not dorky.

*** 2012 [7/7]

**** DONE CODE

2012 Jan 9
Charles Petzold

A great book about all things Code. And not just computer code... this book
offered a great glance into the past of man's struggle with representing
information. I honestly learned a lot about the internals of computers. As
critisism goes, the last chapter had a title that refered to one thing, yet
the contents felt like one topic mashed in after another, which lead to a
sort of “Oh, so we're done then” ending. The last paragraph brought
everything back around full circle, but I felt there needed to be a more
fleshed out conclusion.

**** DONE The Great Hunt

2012 Jan 11
Robert Jordan

Another great book. The characters have come a long way. I was quite
satisfied with the epic scene (blowing of the horn, riding with the fallen
heroes, battle with the Dark One) that came near to the end, by the same
formula of the first book. Of the girls, I like Min. Perrin also didn't get
enough spotlight, I felt.

**** DONE Beyond Religion: Ethics for a Whole World

2012 Feb 7
Dalai Lama

Great. Just the book I needed. I've started meditation practice and it's
really interesting to start thinking about my thoughts and emotions more. Up
until the 11th chapter, however, there were several parts that felt very
“light” in that the Dalai Lama would say “We should strive to <insert
profound thing here>” as if it were a simple task.

**** DONE 分身

**** DONE LYING

2012 Aug 3
Sam Harris

A short book on lying. More of an essay, really. It taught me that to lie,
white lies included, is to deny others reality. It is a refusal to further
your relationship with someone. Truth need only be repeated, while lies need
to be maintained. Lies that one tells to protect someone's feelings can lead
them to decisions that we didn't intend on them making. In the long run,
they are worse off.

Telling the truth doesn't mean you have to be blunt and rude all the time,
it just means you have to be wise with your words. “Truth” can mean many
things.

**** DONE When Parents Text

2012 Aug 14

Gift from my sisters. Quite funny. Laughed out loud a number of times. Was a
good eye-opener to the world of parent-child relationships through
technology.

**** DONE The Grand Design

2015 Aug 22
Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow

Had to think. Not a light read, but I was still hooked. This strengthened my
understanding of quantum physics, and brought me up to speed on current
ideas in the field (M-Theory, etc.). Though some of the ideas were hard to
follow, I'd like to know more. Glad I read this book.

**** DONE Effective Programming: More Than Writing Code

2012 Aug 28
Jeff Atwood

A set of blog entries compiled into a book. Jeff has a lot of practical
advice for people in the programming field, as well as general life advice.
It wasn't fiction and thus has no plot, making it easy to pick up again and
search straight for an article to reread. I will be doing this.

**** DONE るろうに剣心

和月伸宏

**** DONE Where Good Ideas Comes From

2012 Nov 2x
Steven Johnson

Ideas are rarely epiphanies that arise from nothing. Most are slow hunches
that grow over time as they collide and coalesce with others from many
fields and many people. Ideas incubate easiest in a “liquid network”. Being
connected in such a network allows new ideas to come in, and your own ideas
to flow out. The author also says it is important to have multidisciplinary
hobbies. I will strive to pursue this.

*** 2013 [6/6]

**** DONE The Dragon Reborn

2013 Jan 26
Robert Jordan

Epic and thrilling right until the end. The characters are growing and
improving, and I'm totally hooked on their world. Was the man in black
everyone called Ba'alzamon actually Ishamael? The way Ba'alzamon is often
described is similar to the way Ishamael was in the Prologue of the series.
This could explain why Lanfear was seemingly defiant, and why no character
has ever appeared proclaiming themselves as Ishamael. Who was Sophie, the
old woman in the dream world, then? Come to think of it, she did make a
slip. She said “Ishamael is a fool” then told Egwene to denounce the Dark
Lord the same  by saying “Ba'alzamon is a fool”. Shall I continue to the
next book right away?

**** DONE 赤い指

**** DONE Until the Sun Falls

2013 sometime
Cecelia Holland

The book was quite long, and after reading all of it, I felt like I really
knew the characters. It was fun to research who they actually were and what
they during their lifetimes. Particularly with Quyuk and Mongke, when
reading of their exploits I felt I knew them, and the articles held my
interest more. Perhaps all study of history should be done this way.

*** 2014 [7/7]

**** DONE Shogun

2014 Jan 15
James Clavell

After Mariko's death Blackthorne seemed to lose his role as Main Character.
I was surprised that the book ended with Toranaga's narration, painting him
human but still very much in control of Blackthorne. I called Toranaga's
secret ambition to be Shogun a mile away, despite what he kept saying.  I
feel like Yabu gave up too easily. Also that it was foolish for him to
switch sides again so close to the end.  Did Mariko have to die? Ask
yourself this again later. A wonderful book overall. Glad I finally finished
it after all these years.

**** DONE This is your Brain on Music

2014 May 9
Daniel J Levitin

The first book about anything psychological that I've read. It was great to
learn about the various sections of the brain and how they're involved in
processing music. The author argues that the emotional connection we have
with music is evolutionary, considering how much of a whole-brain experience
listening to music is. Apart from the brain, I also learned about how sound
works and its relation to music. A great educational read.

**** DONE 永遠のゼロ

2014 sometime
百田尚樹

宮部久蔵。泣いたね。それぞ本って感じだったな。長さあっての本だと思う。太平洋
戦争のことも沢山知れて読む価値かなりあり。

**** DONE A Game of Thrones

2014 July
George RR Martin

He holds nothing back in this book. A lot more graphic than Sword of Truth,
I think. Feels like it could have been real.

**** DONE A Clash of Kings

2014 July 27
George RR Martin

GRRM didn't disappoint with the sequel. Wow. Theon pissed me off and seemed
a bit one-dimensional. My favourite chapters to read are Arya, Tyrion, and
Jon. It seems like they get POVs in the next book as well, so I'm happy.
Davos got gradually more interesting, but Daenerys chapters didn't thrill me
terribly. The spooky building the Undying lived in an the steps needed to
traverse it without being lost forever was very reminiscent of the trial the
female mages had to go through in Wheel of Time.

The Battle of Blackwater was very clear in my head and was a joy to read.

**** DONE A Storm of Swords

2014 sometime
George RR Martin

**** DONE A Feast for Crows

2014 sometime
George RR Martin

*** 2015 [6/6]

**** DONE The Name of the Wind

2015 sometime
Patrick Rothfuss

An interesting book in a complex world, but not much seems to happen. I
think this is the kind of series that needs to be considered as a block, as
a whole story, before it can be judged.

**** DONE 叡智の断片

2015 June
池澤夏樹

つまり引用の集まり。日本は人の発言を記録して日常的に出したりしない文化だから
、その分析を日本人の立場から見るのは面白かった。

作者の他の本を読むのがいいかもしれん。

**** DONE The Martian

2015 June 30
Andy Weir

Man-vs-Nature, on Mars. The book created a very tangible Mars. Its vast
emptiness was easily imaginable. This was probably easier, since I've seen
actual photos of the planet.

Space outside of Earth felt dangerous. It really felt like the universe is
trying its hardest to be hostile to life. This little pearl we live on is a
unique thing.

Could I have survived like Mark did? Not as I am. With Mark's knowledge? I
don't know. Would I have given up where Mark didn't? Certainly I would have
been able to handle the isolation. Media would be enough to keep me going.

**** DONE レベル7

**** DONE Influx

2015 Dec 12
Daniel Suarez

Why does he always have to end his books so poorly, so consistently? The
latter half of the book could have gone in a plethora of different
directions, and it seems that Suarez picked the least interesting potential
plot branch. To quote a review from GoodReads, the ending was rushed and
contrived. While the first half of the novel could be said to be better than
Daemon, the crash from the latter half is, in my opinion, irreconcilable.

Plot holes / points of interest:
- It made no sense that the AIs wouldn't have known about the university
tunnels that Jon and Denise used.
- Using a gravis would illuminate your position via the fifth dimension. The
BTC would always know where you were.
- What happened to Alexa's disassociation episodes?
- Alexa descended from the rising BTC to meet Jon much too quickly.
- Cotton killed the hundreds (if not thousands) of BTC workers who would
have been in the building when it was lifted into space. Remember the baby?
- Morrison mentioned that the Hibernity cells were separated, deep in the
earth, and encased in rock. How did the US forces get them all out so
quickly?
- What happened to BTC Russia and Asia?

**** DONE Storm Front

2015 Dec 20
Jim Butcher

A fun mystery told in first-person. Other than being a wizard, Harry seems
like a normal guy. The book itself was really easy to read, and actually
ends pretty quickly.

I didn't like how the author introduced many book-worthy backstory elements
all at once. It felt like he was rushing to make his protagonist seem deep
and complicated. I thought this way in particular when He Who Walks Behind
was brought up in the police station.

*** 2016 [12/12]

**** DONE Fool Moon

2016 Jan 1
Jim Butcher

Much more action packed than the first book. I liked how in depth he went
with the various werewolf types.

Near the end there was very much a feeling of 'There is no way he is getting
out of this alive.'

**** DONE Grave Peril

2016 Feb 9
Jim Butcher

This was my favourite so far. There was very much a sense of dread
throughout the book. The interactions with the vampire court, the Nightmare
and Harry were fascinating. I felt as ignorant of the truth as Harry did,
and was surprised when the truth was revealed. Harry also showed us more of
what he was capable of magically.

Great, satisfying, if not sad, ending.

**** DONE Summer Knight

2016 Feb 17
Jim Butcher

Didn't live up to the hype as The-Best-in-the-Series, and the tone was
somehow lighter than Grave Peril. Still, I enjoyed it. The book gave us a
view into the worlds of the White Council and the Faeries, both of which we
previously knew little about. I think I did myself a disservice by reading
the ending late at night.

The twist worked on me; I didn't think the culprit would be Aurora.

As the series progresses, things are getting gradually more fantastical.
This book ending with a mass-Faerie battle in the sky is evidence of that.

**** DONE Death Masks

2016 Mar 18
Jim Butcher

This one wasted no time getting started. Little was resolved, but a new
major character/group was introduced. I imagine they'll be in play for some
time.

Death Masks was more consistently thrilling than *Summer Knight*. I think
the title is referring to Shiro, his terminal condition and fate to die.

**** DONE Blood Rites

2016 Apr 8
Jim Butcher

It seems like all I've been reading is Jum Butcher. The stories are good,
I have to give him that. Dresden himself is an odd creature, and I don't
know if he is a reflection of Butcher himself. I wouldn't be surprised
if that were the case.

Dresden fancies himself 'old fashioned' regarding women, which he is
chastised for. Yet he is completely subservient to them. He admits
himself that he can't refuse a pretty face, and over the course of the
books it's lead him into trouble more than once. He is now making
obvious his attraction to Karrin, but she, surprise surprise, falls for
the bad-boy alpha male (Kincaid). Perhaps then Butcher is aware of that gender
dynamic, as he didn't just throw Karrin at Dresden's feet for saving her
umpteen times.

Dresden is odd, because he's closer to the beta end of the spectrum
mentally, while still fearlessly kicking ass like an alpha. This seems to me
like a beta fantasy, but I don't know enough about Jim Butcher himself to
make a call as to whether Dresden is a reflection of him. Perhaps I should
just stop judging the book for its author, and just accept the message
as-is.

**** DONE Dracula

2016 Apr 25
Bram Stoker

What a drawing book. I could hardly put this down the entire time I was
reading it. I feels like a lengthy novel, but it's hard to tell as I read it
on my Kindle. Even so, I completed it in a week or two.

What a thrill. Somehow I was surprised that an 'old' book could be so
enticing and well written. Why should the present day have a monopoly on
'good literature'? I felt terror for Jonathan Harker as he toiled through
Castle Dracula, sadness at the party's failure to protect Lucy, and tension
toward their pursuit of Dracula through both England and wilder Europe.

Nearing the end I felt no surity that good would prevail and Dracula would
be slain. I can attribute this to the wealth of Dracula lore that has
followed this book. Is Dracula truly dead? The book would have us believe
so, as Dracula crumbled to dust and Mina was freed from her curse. Games
like Castlevania would argue otherwise. I will do more research.

**** DONE The Golden Compass

2016 May

A kids books, and yet it isn't. There are some heavy themes and scientific
content that I'm not convinced a child would be interested in. A fun book
overall though. It paints a picture of a deep and complex world, without
going into too much detail. There are sequels, so I suppose I'll find out
more there.

I started my new job this month, and saw a dip in casual reading time. I
have no commute anymore, meaning there is no time to kill reading.

**** DONE Macbeth

2016 June

The tragedy. The last time I read this was in high school, and I quite
enjoyed going over it again. I've always enjoyed Shakespeare, probably
something to do with my fascination for languages.

Shakespeare has been analysed to death over the centuries, so I doubt I have
much to add. That said, here are some avenues of thought:

Did Macbeth really want to kill Duncan?
Was Duncan a good king?
How long did Macbeth rule?
Why did the Macbeths assume that Duncan's murder was the only way to fulfill the prophecy?

I compared this to the movie To Kill a Man, where Carmen's thought was that
the main character "didn't follow through" with his decision. Yes he killed
the guy, but he didn't own the decision, and eventually his guilt tore him
apart. Macbeth on the other hand owns his decision too much, and kills
everything he even remotely considers a threat to his rule. Had he just
ended his murders with Duncan, it's likely that everything would have been
fine.

A week or two after finishing, Carmen and I watched the 2015 movie version
of Macbeth. It was decent, using mostly Scottish actors and locations. They
had to cut out quite a lot of content, but the story remained in tact.
Without my priming Carmen of the plot, she probably would have had trouble
following the film.

**** DONE The End of Eternity

2016 June 24
Isaac Asimov

Read on Carmen's recommendation. This is a good book up until the last
chapter of the book. With the last chapter, it's an /amazing/ book. This is
easily in my top 5 of books, and definitely deserves a place on the
bookshelf.

The main character Harlan is extremely flawed. Perhaps too much so,
especially given the calm-and-calculating image he presents to us from the
beginning. Despite him saying how subtle he needed to be with his plans, he
was always the first to lose his patience and temper and blurt out whatever
he was thinking. Often, comically, he was wrong. When he /was/ right, it
seems like those conclusions had been given to him by external forces
without his realizing. This leads to the idea that Harlan never had agency
over his actions until the very end, where he himself made the final
decision to spare Noys and thus destroy Eternity. That single autonomous
action of his was enough, in my mind, to solidify his role as the
protagonist and hero.

I liked Asimov's version of time travel in this book. It very much supported
my idea that there are entire realms of scientific possibility out there,
but we aren't aware of them because we haven't yet made some critial
discovery about the universe. Then, having discovered it, we look back and
think: how did humanity ever get by without knowing about this?

My comment upon finishing: "It's us."

**** DONE Dead Beat

2016 July 15
Jim Butcher

His longest so far, and another exciting, easy read. The ending was really
entertaining, and I'm enjoying where the overall story is headed.

**** DONE The Da Vinci Code

2016 July 21
Dan Brown

What an excellent, excellent book. No other has made me go "Wait, really?"
to the point where I have to look up facts and paintings on the internet as
I'm reading. I kept telling Carmen "This could be real" and yeah, it feels
like it could be. This was one book that I just couldn't put down.

It makes for a nice romantic story, that the Grail isn't what we've thought
it was. I think the idea of Jesus having real descendants is a cool idea
too. But why not reveal the truth to the world?

At first I thought /The Teacher/ was Fache. I think we were all supposed to.
But in a sudden revelation this morning, while laying half-conscious in bed,
it came to me: what if Teabing is The Teacher?

Clues that it was Fache:
- He was a devout Christian, could have been working for the Vatican.
- He seems to know too much.
- He was oldly missing when it felt like he shouldn't be.
- He was in contact with Bishop Aringarosa. /Wait, how did that happen?/
- Mentions of an "id badge" when entering Westminster Abbey.
- Fache had lost his savings, he needed the money from the Bishop.
- He could have used his influence to wire tap people.
- The Teacher spoke English with a French accent.

Clues that is was Teabing:
- It was obvious that it was Fache, and thus it couldn't be.
- Fache would have had his own gun, he wouldn't need to take the revolver
from the Jag.
- Teabing showed early on that he could speak French.
- It made no sense that Remy would be spying on the top members of the
Priory from their own barn without direction. It didn't make sense that
Fache would even know where to start in that search.
- Teabing's lengthy absence in the back of the plane with Remy and Silas.
- Remy's desperation in taking Teabing "hostage".

**** DONE 北斗の拳

2016 November

I had forgotten a lot of the plot, so this was a good reread. This time I
actually read ahead past the time skip, but since I'm missing the last few
volumes I don't know how it ends.

*** 2017 [12/12]

**** DONE Animal Farm

2017 January 0x
George Orwell

I read this in tandem with some general research into the history of
Communism. My conclusions so far are that Communism is never possible if run
by human beings. A corallary is that the road to Communism via a
Dictatorship of the Proliterat will always devolve into something distopian.

**** DONE The Three Body Problem

2017 January 17
Cixin Liu

Amazing first-contact story that also served as a good window into how
Communism (particularly the Cultural Revolution) in China affected normal
people.

**** DONE Barbarians

2017 January 19
Lauren Southern

While her points aren't particularly well-argued, her claims are generally
correct.

**** DONE Dragon's Egg

2017 April ??
Robert L. Forward

A great book! Most of all, it made me consider the how different life forms
might live at different "speeds". Perhaps cats perceive humans as being
these slow, lumbering creatures?

**** DONE Cosmos

2017 June 11
Carl Sagan

It felt like a accurate description of how the world would react to proof of
contact from an alien race. Kitz's aggressive skepticism at the end was
interesting, but the image found in pi was profound on a level that reminded
me of End of Eternity.

The movie (which I watched afterward on the same day) was a faithful
adaptation. Things were changes of course, but they were done tastefully.

**** DONE Hamlet
     CLOSED: [2017-08-25 Fri 15:33]

2017 June 26
William Shakespeare

I need to think more on this.

**** DONE The Wise Man's Fear

2017 August 24
Patrick Rothfuss

I couldn't put this book down until I finished all 1100 pages of it.
Since I had read the first book so long ago (first half of 2015?) it was
tricky at first to reimmerse myself in the world, but I soon got over that.

This was a great continuation of the story. It's heartbreaking to see modern-day Kvothe
as defeated as he is. My favourite section overall involved Kvothe's time with the
Ademre - Rothfuss was able to portray a different culture very convincingly.
The language mistakes that the Ademre made when speaking Aturan were largely
believable. I enjoyed most learning about the Lethani, the philosophy that grounds
their culture. North American culture would benefit from some Lethani, I think.
**** DONE Vagabond

Inoue Takehiko

I think this was my third read-through of the series. It's not complete yet, but
I had bought the latest chapter during my recent trip to Japan in September.
It's too bad that the series doesn't have more momentum.

Vagabond is one of my favourites. It might actually be my favourite manga.
Why... well, the art, for starters. It has a good dose of philosophy,
convincing story telling, and a believable evolution of the main character.
I really want to see who Musashi becomes by the end of his life.

**** DONE Meditations

2017 October
Marcus Aurelius

His personal philosophies, generally easy to read and understand. He cared
about making sense, but didn't imagine any audience but himself.

There were points I disagreed with, to be sure, but in general I was receptive
to what he had to say regarding life:

- Human beings are meant to cooperate.
- Everyone has a /directing mind/ that they should cherish and use.
- Be a man and do a man's work.

To oversimplify, his philosophies qualify the expression "don't sweat the small stuff".
**** DONE Hokuto no Ken

2017 November 15
原哲夫

A story of men doing what they had to do. Kenshiro himself has a strong sense of
good and evil, and he makes no hesitation in killing people who are evil.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Yes, you are evil. I have the power to destroy you, making the world better.
I'm going to kill you now.
#+END_QUOTE

Although that's not the world that I live in, I suppose.

The entire second half (post timeskip) didn't have to happen. It could have,
and should have, ended with Rao's death. Kenshiro goes off with Yuria, and
eveyone's fate is left to our imagination. The only redeeming part was the
sections on grown-up Rin and Bat - that they would become freedom fighters.
The rest of it (including Falco, the Emperor, the Land of Shura, everything)
was superfluous. Speaking of which, why is the sister of the emperor just
living alone out in the desert like nothing's changed? Why did Ken
basically abandon Ryuu, saying he had nothing else to teach him?

... because those story archs were stupid, and we should ignore them as canon.

**** DONE I, Strahd: Memoirs of a Vampire

2017 November 24
P.N. Elrod

It was easy to get sucked in and want to find out what happens next. The plot
wasn't complicated and nothing was "surprising" per se since I knew the
overall ending already, but I still enjoyed it.

I have a deeper understanding of Strahd's relationship with Sergei, as well
as the events of the wedding day where Tatyana died the first time.
Interesting that "being shot by his guards" was actually a revolt!
I also quite enjoyed seeing the "Marina" event in more detail as well.
Interesting that she is actually quite receptive to Strahd, once he starts
feeding off her.

Some other discrepancies:

- Many more towns were mentioned, not just the three (and Berez) that we
  can visit in Curse of Strahd.
- Strahd's mother was long dead - she didn't die on the trip to Barovia.
- Rahadin (or any Dusk Elf) was not mentioned. Alek filled that roll.
- No mention of the Order of the Silver Dragon.
- No mention of the Amber Temple. The Dark Powers ("Death") appeared
  before him in the castle.

The books ends with Strahd sitting down to eagerly write more. What
could have happened? I suppose that's my choice now.

Before this book, I knew basically nothing about Rome. Now, I at least have an
appreciation for its overall history, and knowledge into the origins of modern
day Europe. The Romans had many of the same problems that we have, and they did
their best to solve them. Over time they moved to one-man-rule, and then
strangely, never wanted to move back. This allowed for a certain bureaucratic
efficiency, so long as the ruler was "good". And by the looks of things, there
were such "good" emperors (re: "The Five Good Emperors").

The author ends her story at the end of the 2nd century CE. That's okay, even
though Rome itself continues for much longer in one form or another. She had
started everything in a sort of "fog of history" around 600 BCE, before which
it's hard to say anything conclusive about Rome. What I find strange is that
well-documented "high society" had been established long before that in other
places, like Egypt and China. Just how many times have there been reboots like
this? My overall impression is that humans are very resourceful, and will always
come back around, given time.

**** DONE Superintelligence

2019 January 29
Nick Bostrom

Hah, an exact month after I finished SPQR!

This was a heavy read. He outlines the types of super-intelligences that could
come about, how quickly they could derive themselves, and how and why they could
form "a singleton" (a unified system that made all major decisions for the
world). To combat these issues, he describes "the control problem", and other
issues involved in loading values / motivations into a software system. From a
programmer's perspective, yes, it isn't clear to me at all how one go about
doing that.

One section in Chapter 13 stood out to me. It was that in order to "directly"
load values into an AI, the programmer would first have to make concrete
judgement calls on many (if not all) of the outstanding philosophical issues
that are open in our civilization. Then, they'd have to know how to encode such
a world-view in a machine. For one programmer - or even a team of them - to have
such understanding and wisdom is highly doubtful to me.

So AI will come, and we need to be prepared for it. Before reading, I had
assumed that we were fairly close. Now, I'm not so sure. The Control and Value
Loading problems are significant enough that even a few decades of thinking
might not crack them. In the meantime, I hope Google does nothing rash, fueled
by good intentions.

If this is real, then humans are capable of a lot, both mentally and physically.
I don't know what I'm capable of. I've never experienced my limits. Tough Mudder
was the hardest physical thing I've done, but even then it wasn't /that/ hard
compared to what some people have achieved. I notice now that I'm very quick to
shut off effort as soon as things get uncomfortable. Not even pain - just
discomfort. How am I supposed to grow that way? Nobody said that the process of
growth would be fun or feel good.

I'm not complete. Right now, I am in a growth phase. I'm building the seeds of a
future for some future version of myself to enjoy. This guy, right now, is not
forever. He will be gone and the true me will shine brightly.

**** DONE Extreme Ownership

2019 December 21
Jocko Willink & Leif Babin

This is all about owning what you touch. If something failed, and you were in
any non-trivial way connected to it, then it's your fault. From this point, you
can blame nobody else. You didn't do your best. You must analyse what went wrong
and what we all could have done better. But especially me. What could /I/ have
done better?

Nobody is going to live your life for you. Nobody but you is going to save you
from the pain and troubles of life.

The rest is about leadership and applying Extreme Ownership in that context.
Even if you're not the boss boss, you still might be in a position to be
somebody's leader. If no one else, then yourself. There are even opportunities
when one has to lead /up/ the chain of command, and lead the leaders.

I have historically failed to lead my women. Once together and established, I
coast. I don't give her or us clear direction. It's important that I have
direction for myself first. Then she is to be integrated into the parts of that
that make sense, and that is then "the relationship". The rest is me, which must
remain clear and unwavering in spite of the relationship.

One good change I have made recently is devoting an hour a week to Life
Planning. This used to happen sporadically. Now I have scheduled time for it,
and it really helps. I should never stop a practice like this, even when in a
relationship. /Especially/ when I'm in one, I need to maintain this.

So while I haven't finished many books, I have still been reading 30+ minutes

**** DONE The Katrina Trilogy

This is a trilogy of short novels written in Esperanto. I read them after
(mostly) completing a textbook on the language, and was pleased that I could
understand the books in their entirety. Only a few words were new to me. I moved
on to a harder book, but have since put it down. I think Japanese is once again
the priority for me, and I'm unsure of the usefulness of Esperanto. Japanese is
certainly more beautiful than it, and obviously has far more speakers.

**** DONE The Year of Living Biblically
     CLOSED: [2020-10-19 Mon 10:06]

A.J. Jacobs
2020 October 19

A man in a situation similar to my own decided to live by as many of the Bible's
rules as he could, as literally as he could. I sped through this book, dying to
know how the process had transformed him. In the end, while he still couldn't
admit belief in the biblical God of his ancestors, he did had a deep
appreciation for life. Many of his daily habits were also improved.

He said at one point something that resonated: that he doesn't think he could
ever be debated into believing in God. So instead he tried to "behave" his way
into belief, based on the idea that our behaviours can shape our minds. I think
this might be the only approach for me as well. I don't think an intellectual
explanation of the metaphysics of any particular religion will ever convince me.
But maybe that's okay. Maybe the metaphysics are a particular "tool", a
"framework", similar to what C.S. Lewis mentioned. If a particular tool or way
of thinking doesn't work for you, then drop it and move on. This creates a new
question in my mind:

#+begin_quote
Is it possible to join a religion and be a meaningful member of it while not
believing its metaphysics?
#+end_quote

What did I learn?

I need to live more for others.
I need to donate more of my money and my time.
I need to be more grateful.
I need to take life more seriously.
I need to ground my daily life in a religion and a group.

God might be watching me. If he isn't, the future of humanity is. If they
aren't, my future family is. If they aren't, then I am.

I appreciate the core of the method, and have been practicing it for two weeks.
I do already see the improvements. Overall I'm calmer, more focused, food tastes
better, and my pushup performance has improved drastically, despite less overall
training time.

It was interesting to hear about his past and how he came to be who he is. The
latter half of the book was mostly filler, and I skimmed over much of it. The
method itself is the core thing anyway, and Wim Hof says as much.

Humanity

I started reading the Bible in February, and read it every day until now without
missing a single day. I didn't dare skip. I read the whole thing out loud,
except for two days some months ago (during Isaiah) where I had a bit of a
bender and stayed up until 2 a.m.

It feels like I have done a good thing. Of course a single reading isn't enough
to understand the entire text (or even much of it!) but it's better than having
never read it. There are lessons I have already added to my life, and can feel
the change. For one thing, it no longer feels right to make fun of religion or
Christianity. I can't call myself a Christian, but it still doesn't feel right.
And a lot of modern society's problems seem to have a clearer cause now that
I've read about past societies and how they degraded into chaos.

**** DONE The Fall of Gondolin

2021 Feb 6
JRR Tolkien

A compilation of the 4 main versions of the Gondolin myth. The first /Tale/ is
the only complete version, but having been written so early many of the details
do not match the final published Silmarillion, nor does it account for the
existence of The Lord of the Rings. I rather preferred the "Last Version" as
Christopher Tolkien calls it. While very detailed, more so even than the
original /Tale/, it was unfortunately abandoned as a work at the point where
Tuor passes through the Hidden Way and first views Gondolin from account
Tumladen.

I'm glad to have read it. My fondness for Gondolin has grown much, and I'm
excited to read The Silmarillion again to solidify more of the surrounding
details.
